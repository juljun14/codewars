Create a function with two arguments that will count by a given number (x) a certain number of times (n).

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array (or list in Python.)

Examples:

countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
